These scripts estimate process criticality accident risk using a Bayesian network and a neural network metamodel. ðŸ¤¯

**dist.R** first needs to be run for the distribution fit called in **source.Rmd** (e.g., "gamma"). Once that's done, everything can be run from **source.Rmd**.

I built 1.6 million MCNP input decks with **generate.R** and **build.R** and ran them on Quartz, a supercomputer at LLNL.
The rest of the scripts were run on a desktop computer (AMD Ryzen 7 1700 3.0 GHz 8-core CPU with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU).
