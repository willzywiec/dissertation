# Dissertation

This repository contains a PDF of my dissertation, as well as modified copies of several scripts I wrote that are included in an appendix. 

Running **source/notebook.Rmd** as-is builds a coupled Bayesian network and neural network metamodel and estimates process criticality accident risk. ðŸ¤¯ These scripts generate approximately 85 GB of data, which is saved to the **test** folder. To avoid saving this data directly to your computer, I recommend moving the **test** folder to an external hard drive and modifying the **test.dir** path on line 51 of **source/notebook.Rmd**.  

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7+  
TensorFlow 2.1+  
CUDA 10+  
R 4+  
Rtools  
MCNP6.2 (optional)  
ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data (optional)  
32+ GB RAM (I initially started this project with 16 GB RAM and quickly ran into memory issues)  

## Running the Code
**install.R** installs all necessary R packages.

MCNP input decks were built using **build/grid.R** and run using **linux/copy.py** and **linux/volley.py**, which are configured to run on Linux using Slurm. The data I used in my dissertation consisted of a 130 MB **data/mcnp-output.csv** file, which contains output from 1,542,397 MCNP simulations that were run on the Quartz supercomputer at LLNL.

With the exception of the MCNP simulations, everything was run on a desktop computer that I built specifically to work on this project (specs below).

**dist/dist.R** needs to be run for the truncated probability distribution fits called in **source/notebook.Rmd** (e.g., 'gamma'). Once that's done, everything can be run from **source/notebook.Rmd**.    
  
All scripts were tested on 4/24/2021 using R 4.0.2, Python 3.8.5, TensorFlow 2.4, and CUDA 11.3.
